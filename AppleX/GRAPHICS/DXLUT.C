Platform     : Apple IIe 128K PRODOS 8
Program      : dxlut.c
Description  : G2 Library Routine
               LUT's (look-up tables) for discrete DHGR pixel color values
               which correspond to the 7 pixels in the 4 byte block.
               Using these to write DHGR pixels eliminates the need to
               extract these values from the dhrbytes array at runtime
               so results in slightly quicker code.

               Quite abstract really... and in Lo-Res color order
               for consistency with the other related G2 library routines.
