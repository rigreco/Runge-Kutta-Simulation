ReadMe file for the Applex\LIB Directory

The text files in this directory list the libraries that correspond
to the text file name. These files are simply output from the Aztec C
lb utility redirected to disk. To list the contents of a library make
sure lb is on path and type lb -t libraryname.lib. This will give you
the latest list... especially for G2.lib which seems to always be
growing.

Note that IO.LIB and SYSIO.LIB are both the same. I made the shorter-
named copy of IO.LIB to save space on the linker line.
