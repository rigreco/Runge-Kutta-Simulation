Saved/recorded files can be found in current_directory/capture 
(can be changed in the configfile). 
The directory has to exist prior to starting DOSBox, otherwise nothing 
gets saved/recorded !


NOTE: Once you increase your DOSBox cycles beyond your computer's maximum
capacity, it will produce the same effect as slowing down the emulation.
This maximum will vary from computer to computer.
