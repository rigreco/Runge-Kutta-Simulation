This Directory contains the two original Aztec C docs from Manx.

The ReadMe is essentially a bug list.

For additional information, you should get a copy of the Aztec C Manual which 
is available online at 

http://www.clipshop.ca/Aztec/cat1.htm and http://www.clipshop.ca/Aztec/cat2.htm

This will provide you with the original text of the printed manual for the C65
compiler
