# Runge-Kutta-Simulation
Runge Kutta 4(5) order simulation suite for Apple II in Aztec C

*  This work is based on 1999-2000 Thesis work of Greco Riccardo coded in ANSI C for x86 and DSP processor.
It implement an Runge Kutta 4(5)^ order integration numerical method of differential equations set
by use of double precision floating point operation in Aztec C65 language.
It allow to simulate different mathematical models such as:
* Resistance Capacitor electrical circuit,
* Direct Current electric motor,
* Alternating Current three phase induction motor.
