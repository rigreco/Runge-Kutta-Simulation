# Runge-Kutta-Simulation
Runge Kutta 45 order simulation suite for Apple II machine in Aztec C

*  This work is based on 1999-2000 Thesis work of Greco Riccardo.
*  It implement an Runge Kutta 4(5)^ order integration numerical method of differential equations set
*  by use of double precision floating point operation in Aztec C65 language.
*  It allow to simulate different mathematical models such as:
*  Resistance Capacitor electrical circuit, Direct Current electric motor,
*  Alternative Current three phase induction motor.
